# Mental Math 2
This website is a tool for students so they can improve their mental math calculation speeds. Numbers are invisible by default and the computer uses text-to-speech to read the numbers aloud. There are buttons that break down/chunk the number into smaller pieces to aid with the calculations, and the website also has a login system so users can keep track of their high scores and compete with their friends.
